## What is this?

**Recon** - most simple and simplified 
library for implementing _protocol applications_, 
_remote data transfer_ and _remote connections with 
servers, sites_, etc.

This is a single **API** association and **many auxiliary 
modules** for both simplifying the code and for new 
functionality.
